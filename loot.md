# Dark Entropy Loot System

Dark Entropy uses a Loot Council system for loot distribution in the core raid. 

- Loot will be distributed by the officers as seen fit. 
- Loot distribution will be based on a variety of factors including but not limited to:
	- Performance in raids
	- Preparedness
	- Attendance
	- Conduct
	- Raid needs (e.g. tank gear prio)
	
- We will make an effort to provide a reasonable level of transparency to the Loot Council process.
	- Most discussions will be private among the officers
	- Non-officer input will be solicited as needed
	- Loot Council votes on who should be awarded gear will be visible through RCLC
	
- The addon RCLC will be used for voting, rolling, and dstribution of loot. 

- Any official guild raids outside the core raid will use a modified rolling system (e.g. +1) to maintain simplicity and speed.
