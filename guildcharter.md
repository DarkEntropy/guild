# Dark Entropy's Mission Statement

Dark Entropy aims to provide a fun, “casual hardcore” environment for its players. Our goal is to clear all current content as rapidly as is reasonably possible upon release, with the intention of having two balanced 25 man raid groups comprising of members, alts, and raiders once the content is reliably cleared.

We require reasonable consumable usage (potions, flasks, food, etc…) and it is appreciated when people bring extras of these to raids. It will neither be counted for, or against you, however if it’s a personal requirement in order to hit the standards outlined by your Class Leader (see below) then it may be taken into consideration.

Our raid times are 8PM to ~11:30PM (sometimes Midnight during progression) server time, on Thursdays and Fridays. Invites start at 7:30PM. We may occasionally schedule off-night raids for content like ZA, older content, etc... however these are not mandatory.

We ask that our players show up to raids knowing their class, boss strategies, and remain present and attentive during our 6-8 hours of raiding per week.

## Performance Expectations

### Raider (and Raider Alt) Expectations:
- Consistently perform at, or above, the level set by your Class Leader/Officer (e.g. Rogues are expected to reliably parse above 50% outside of extenuating circumstances)
- Show up to raids prepared, knowing strategies and having appropriate gear (moderate FR gear, Ony cloak, etc…)
- Be present and attentive during raids
- AFKing is fine as needed, but let your CL and/or Officers know
- Don’t die to avoidable things
- Make efforts to obtain BIS gear outside of raid content where needed (e.g. HOJ, Baron cloak, etc…)
- Be online and available for raids at, or very shortly after, invite time (7:30PM server time Thurs/Fri) whenever feasible
- You consistently confirm your attendance availability in Discord signups within a reasonable amount of lead time before the raid (ideally > 2 days before), and are reliably available for all required raid nights (currently Thursday/Friday)
- Be present and participate when appropriate in class/role-specific commutation channels, such as in-game and discord class/role channels.

### Raider Promotion Expectations:
- A minimum of 4 main raids (4 weeks) of content must be attended for evaluation purposes within a 6 week period
- You have shown yourself to be personable and fit in with the guild (don’t be a dick)
- As a rank below Raider, you have made reasonable effort to be available for raids even if benched
- When in raids, you show up prepared as outlined for Raider expectations
- There is a need for your class/spec within one of the raid groups
- Specifically, we will not look to demote someone specifically to make a spot available, nor do we necessarily wish to oversaturate a class/spec

### Raider Demotion Expectations:
- Low performance will be addressed by the Class Leader, or other Officers, with the goal of helping the Raider improve their performance
- If continued low performance, inattentiveness, showing up unprepared, repeated AFKing, etc…, the Raider will be demoted to Member status
- If the demoted Raider wishes to go back to Raider status, they will go through a new trial period as a probation

### Casual/Member Expectations:
- We invite our Casual players and Members to raid with us whenever is feasible! 
- We ask that these players be at, or near, “pre-BIS” gear sets in order to be able to meaningfully contribute to the raid. Exceptions might be made to invite players with lesser gear, however preference will be given to those who can pull their weight.
- Similar to raiders, we simply ask that you confirm attendance well in advance of the raid, through the signup spreadsheet, so that we can balance groups.
- If there’s space (and time), we’re happy to have casuals & alts sub in for fights like Majordomo or Onyxia in order to get things like Hunter/Priest quest items, etc...

### "Class Leader" Expectations:
- Be knowledgeable in your class, know fights and how to direct players of your class.
- Understand all specs of your class, research ahead for future tiers, understand gear implications to help players plan their reserves
- Work with players in your class to improve their performance where needed, either 1 on 1 or in a group setting.
- Lead by example, meeting and exceeding the Raider expectations
- Assist with raid balance through identifying player availability and capability, and handling invites and group building on raid nights
- Have a read on the pulse of your class/role, and when there are issues or concerns, identify them and propose solutions to leadership.
- Provide feedback on new members and promotions, and support recruiting efforts.

### "Raid Leader" Expectations:
- Designate a person to handle assignments of Tanks, Healers, Pullers, Main Assist, Master Looter.
- Handle any issues that arise during the raid. Make the final call on any decisions
- Summarize past "lessons learned" or special "things to try" before bosses in order to improve raid performance (eg: Garr add positioning, Domo cleave,etc…)
- Observe the raid, and afterwards summarize what went well / what could be improved / your recommendations. Communicate the learnings to guild leadership, and to the other raid leader (eg raid 2).
