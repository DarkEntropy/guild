# Second Raid Team

Dark Entropy supports a second raid team (RAID-B) in addition to our core raid team (RAID-CORE). The second team provides the following benefits:
- A mechanism for our casual players, friends and family, and alts to raid. 
- A feeder for RAID-CORE: when we inevitably lose players from RAID-CORE we can bring promising candidates up from RAID-B.

The framework for RAID-B will be as follows:
- RAID-B will be largely autonomous 
- Loot will be distributed via simple rolling system that requires no maintenance (e.g. +1)
- Raid times will be determined based on availability of participating players. 
- Recruiting for RAID-B will be conducted as needed to ensure healthy attendance and composition
- The officers will designate one or more official Raid Leaders for RAID-B. 
	- RL will have the same responsibilities as RAID-CORE raid leader
	- RL will be responsible for conducting the raid in a pleasant and effective manner.
	- RL can delegate tasks as needed but will be responsible for the results. 
	
Additional notes
- RAID-B will in no circumstances be allowed to negatively impact the success or performance of RAID-CORE
- RAID-B is inteded to provide a casual, but focused environment for those not in RAID-CORE
- No loot prio for RAID-CORE members attending a RAID-B raid.
